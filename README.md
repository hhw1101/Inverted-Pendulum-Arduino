**Arduino Apps for Windows and Android**

​



​

We know that [ArduinoApps](https://www.sabelectronic.com/2022/04/arduino-apps.html)[ ](https://www.sabelectronic.com/2020/08/aruino-apps.html) Used for Programming. But we could run it on Windows Or Android. As it depends on the availability of a programming device for our projects.

​





These Apps can help to learn and create electronic projects. I will describe the functions and introductory of the following application and also support systems

​

required to run.

​

**Arduino apps for Windows**

---

**Arduino IDE**

Arduino IDE is open-source software for [Arduino programming](https://www.sabelectronic.com/2020/05/getting-started-with-arduino-uno.html). It is very easy to install. The software has a beta version and hourly based, any of them can program Arduino.

​

It widely used for Arduino Projects. Here the downloads for only windows, but for mac OS and Linux.

**mblock**

​

If you don't enjoy programming with difficult languages, the mblock is the best option for programming. It is also an open-source tool. It is a scratch-based coding platform software designed for Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics \(STEAM\) education.

​

We use it for Arduino Mega2560 and a micro bit. The latest version is mblock 5 for windows 7/8/10. It is a drag & drop type block-based Developer tool. It is available at the App Store for iPhone and iPad. This is also an



Arduino app for android and gets from Google play store. Mblock is mostly used for

​

robotics projects.

​

**Ardublockly**
​

Ardublockly is used to program Arduino, a useful visual programming editor. Which Easily generates. Arduino code JavaScript used for creating block-based visual programming languages \(VPLs\) and editors.

​
​

Ardublockly runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. Ardublockly is free and open-source Arduino app. It is block-based programming, Just select blocks and makes a program.

​
**Arduino UNO Simulator**


The Arduino UNO simulator is a Windows and Android-based Software \(at play store with many available\) that provide a virtual representation of a real-world Arduino circuit. It is a virtual version of exactly the same circuit.

**PartSim**

​

Partsim is a freeware software, and it is easy to apply a circuit simulator. parts run in your Internet Browser. You can use it online. This circuit simulator also used to calculate current in each loop.

​

Android Apps for Electronics solutions. It is an easy-to-use Arduino Application in Apple Android.Arduino Droid app for Mobiles Droid v 4.9.1.

​

The app works on PC and an example for Arduino also available. It includes IDE, compiler, and up-loader. the mobile memory should be enough and it can't be set up on an SD card for Android protection policy.

​

In the second picture shows a menu, it looks easy to program Arduino. all options Will display By clicking the upright button. Arduino Libraries can add as in Arduino Ide.

​
**Blynk Apps for IoT**

​

Blynk is one of the best Arduino Apps of Blynk Inc for android to use with ESP8266, ESP32, NodeMCU, and also works with Raspberry Pi. Blynk also supports Bluetooth Low energy \(BLE\). this is an Arduino Bluetooth controller app for wireless devices.
​

It contains a lot of examples and a set of libraries to build an internet of things \(IoT\) easily, even if you have little experience in electronics. With the Blynk just connect Sensors and you can control output modules e.g. Motors, actuators, or robotics vehicles. It is available from Blynk official site.
